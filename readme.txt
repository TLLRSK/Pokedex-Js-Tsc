#POKEDEX APP - Javascript + Typescript

Showing first generation pokemons (0-151) using PokeApi.
Includes Search by name and Filter by type.

#WHAT I'VE LEARNT:

- Using REST API:
    - Fetch & Await
    - Asynchrony and promises
    - Minimize number of requests

- Looping arrays searching and filtering objects/values.

- Closures
    - Pass URL and Pokedex management as factory functions

- Modules
    - Import/Export
    - Dividing code in three modules: pokedexUrl, pokedex and main

- Typescript
    - Run typescript 😎
    - Hard typing
    - Creating and using interfaces
